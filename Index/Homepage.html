<h2>Website overview (motivation)</h2>
	<p1> Many people have acquired a variety of skills in university. It is necessary for them to find out which skill can be used to find the best-fit job with a decent salary. Our website will help job seekers find the best job using different visualizations. We offer two main functions on our website including view job postings by salary and view jobs by skills.  </p1>
<h2>Data</h2>
	<p1>Our dataset was manually collected from open Ottawa job posting website. We have six attributes including job title, salary, date, skill, job category (part-time or full time) and job type (major).  <br /> </p1>
	<p2 style="font-size:170%;">Attribute types:  <br /> </p2>

	<P3 style="font-size:150%;">Quantitative: salary, date <br />
	Ordinal: skills <br />
	Categorical: job category (part-time or full time), job type (major) <br />
	</p3>
<h2>Task Analysis</h2>

	<p1>Let's suppose that user Mark is a Carleton University student looking for a summer job and is now using our system to find a job he can do at the right salary and at the right time. Our web system is very easy to operate. Mark can complete the job search in three steps:</p1><br/><br/>
	<p3>Step 1, list all the skills and knowledge he already has.</p2><br/>
	<p3>Step 2, use node to find out all the jobs he can apply for and review the other skills/knowledge/degrees needed for the job.</p2> <br/>
	<p3>Step 3, use the bubble chart to find the best salary and time for all the jobs he can apply for.</p2><br/>
<h2>Design Process</h2>
	<p2> Initail Sketches: After knowing about our users, tasks and datasets, we
  created three initail sketches for our visualization.
</p2><br/>


<p3>Firstly, there is a salary visualization on our view job postings by salary page. We listed some important skills in the columns and salary-related to different skills in the rows. Different jobs will be shown on the visualization. Besides the visualization, we provided the job list on the left side of the webpage. The list includes images and a short description of each job.
  When users clicking on a certain job, this job will be highlighted in the job list.Secondly, we offer a skills mind map on the view jobs by skills webpage. The mind map visualizes skills the users already have and skills they still need to acquire for certain jobs. </p3></div>

  <p2> Final Design:Based on our initial sketches, we created our final sketches using AI. We made some changes from the initial sketches.</p2> <br/>

  <p3> 1. View related jobs by clicking a skill:The structure includes three levels, with the skill that the user clicked at the center,
  the second level for all the work that needs this skill, and the third level for all the other skills that the job requires.</p3><br/>

<p3> 2. View jobs posting by salary: Different filters on the top menu including job type and salary range. When the user clicks on the filter,
  the job list and bubble chart will be updated. Linked highlighting function highlighting the selected job in the job list.

<h2>Final Visualization</h2>

	<p1 id="subtitle 1">Node-linked Diagram:</p1><br/><br/>

	<p3 id = "texts 2">The structure includes three levels, with the skill that the user clicked at the center, the second level for all the work that needs this skill, and the third level for all the other skills that the job requires.
  <br/>Interactive elements: 1. tooltip 2. Convert the main view based on the user's click</p2><br/><br/>

	<p1 id="subtitle 2">Bobble Chart</p1><br/><br/>

	<p3 id="texts 3">On our bubble chart webpage, we developed a job category filtering function using JavaScript. The webpage will show different visualizations (part-time or full time) according to usersâ€™ selection.
    Part-time chart shows salary per hour while the full-time chart shows salary per year.
    For the visualization itself, we chose to use two linked interactive charts (bubble chart and bar chart).
    The bubble chart shows different skills and their corresponding salaries while the bar chart shows the job types (major) and their corresponding salaries.
    Colours are used to differentiate job types. The user can make an interval selection in the bubble chart and the bar chart will be updated according to their selection.
<br/>Interactive elements: 1. tooltip 2. linked interactive charts 3. interval selection
  </p2><br/>

<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p1>As for now, the main structure of our website and all the interactive visualizations are completed:</p1><br/><br/>
	<p3>1. A homepage that contains all kinds of information about our website(an overview, data, tasks and sketches, etc.) as well as the two buttons which link to the two webpages.</p2><br/>
	<p3>2. A node-link diagram page, which includes three levels, with the skill that the user clicked at the center, the second level for all the work that needs this skill, and the third level for all the other skills that the job requires.</p3><br/>
	<p4>3. A bubble chart page, which users could view jobs by filter job category(full-time/part-time). After that, they could compare salaries with different job required skills.</p4><br/>
	<p5>In conclusion, we have finished 90% coding of our website with interactive visualizations. The next thing we'll do is finding problems and bugs by testing the website.</p5><br/>
